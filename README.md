# human-like-passwords
This repository has an implementation of password generator that created passwords similar to the way humans do.
## Password Types
This generator can create any of 4 types of passwords:
1. *A Popular Password* - A password that is among Top 100 most common passwords (Generated 5-10% of the time).
2. *Relatively Popular Password* - A password that is among the first million of popular passwords (Generated 50-90% of the time). Keep in mind that passwords from the first category may appear here although the odds are pretty low.
3. *Absolutely random password* - A password generated randomly but with the intension that Human can remember it (Generated 1-5% of the time).
4. *Random Humanlike Password* - It's a password that resembles one that regular Human could come up with (All the rest passwords belong to this category).
Take into consideration that the percentage of password distribution into category=ies is random all the time.
